/**
 * Listens for `PointsManuallyChanged` and dispatches the notification to the
 * recipient. Mirrors verified's SendNotificationWhenUserIsVerified pattern:
 * keep the controller thin, do the notification work in a listener.
 *
 * The NotificationSyncer routes through every registered driver — that means
 * the `alert` driver (DB row + bell-icon UI) AND any push driver (e.g.
 * flarum/realtime if installed). The frontend's websocket listener bumps the
 * unread count and clears the notification list to force a refetch, so the
 * recipient sees it in real time.
 *
 * SELF-EXCLUDE: when the admin is awarding/revoking points on their own
 * account, we skip the notification. Showing a "You gave yourself points"
 * card to the actor that just took the action would be confusing and the
 * marketplace audit (§46.3) recommends this kind of recipient filter.
 *
 * LOGGING: uses PSR-3 LoggerInterface — never the `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log`
 * facade. CLAUDE.md §41: the facade adds a hidden global dependency, breaks
 * under tests that don't boot the facade root, and obscures the dependency
 * graph. Constructor injection is the supported path.
