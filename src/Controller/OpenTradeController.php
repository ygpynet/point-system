/**
 * POST /api/point-system/trades
 * Body: { recipientId: int }
 *
 * Opens a new trade session with another user. The created trade starts in
 * status=pending with both points = 0 and no items, both accepts cleared.
 * The recipient receives a notification so they know the request is waiting.
 *
 * Guards:
 *   - actor must hold `pointSystem.claim` (same permission used to claim
 *     items — keeps the privilege story consistent)
 *   - target must be a real user, NOT the actor themselves
 *   - actor can only have ONE open trade with a given recipient at a time;
 *     a duplicate request returns the existing pending trade so the UI
 *     reopens it instead of spawning sibling rows
